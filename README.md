# Finding a Best Location in Montreal, Canada to Open a new Restaurant
# Introduction
Montreal is the most populous, diverse city in the Canadian province of Quebec and the secondmost
populous city in Canada. It is an old city and has a lot of attraction place for tourist. Each
year millions of tourists visits Montreal so, it has multibillion-dollar restaurant business.
There are many restaurants in the city of Montreal and many more are being built. Of course, the
market is highly competitive and as a well-developed city, the cost of doing business is also one
of the highest in the country.

The choosing location of the restaurant is one of the most important decisions that will determine
whether the mall will be a success or a failure. In this project we will find the best location to
start a restaurant using data science techniques.

## Business Problem
The objective of this capstone project is to analyze and select the best locations in the city of
Montreal, Canada to open a new restaurant. As a startup, they need to choose their first starting
location carefully for the points highlighted above and more importantly, if this is successful, they
will be able to replicate the same success fairly quickly; so, first mover advantage is critical for
this business and thereby the choice of location (i.e. neighborhood) is important to them.

## Target Audience
This project is particularly useful to property developers and investors looking to open or invest
in new restaurant in the city of Montreal. This project is timely as the city is currently suffering
from oversupply of shopping malls. However, the number of visitors is increasing each year and
city has initiated to many measures to attract more visitor. Therefore, city needs new restaurant
and hence opening a new restaurant would be a very profitable business.

# Data Description
To solve the problem, we will need the following data:
* As we need to explore, segment, and cluster the boroughs in the city of Montreal, the Montreal suburbs or borough data is key for this project.
* Latitude and longitude coordinates of those suburbs. This is required in order to plot the map and to get the venue data.
* Venue data, particularly data related to shopping malls. We will use this data to perform clustering on the neighborhoods.

## Data Features
We will be leveraging on features in a reliable location information provider such as the
Foursquare.com to explore the various types of venues and its categories available in each
neighborhood. We will also need to understand the trending of these venues in the respective
neighborhood. The information obtained per neighborhood will be as such like below and must
be in a structured format.
